Head there, and you will be greeted with confusing links. Yep. But I'm here to guide you. You can see that it is listed with:

	1. JDK 			(Java Development Kit)
	2. Server JRE		(Server Java Runtime Environment)
	3. JRE			(Java Runtime Environment)


JDK is what we needs, as we are Java Developers, we need all the tools to develop the program.
JRE is for the end user, mostly those who do not know what Java is, all they might now is how to make
the program runs.

Enough chit-chat. Click the JDK, and you will see a lsit of downloadable file.

First, **accept the license** using the radio button. Select the latest version, usually the top most. Select according to your machine

	Solaris SPARC 64-bit
	Solaris SPARC 64-bit

Just install it with how you're machine usually install.
