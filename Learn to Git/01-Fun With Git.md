# Getting Started With Project

Save the theory for later. We're going to start having fun with Git. There are easy and hard way to learn. And we're going to start learning the hard -- but fun way, to learn it.

For those who wonder, why should I waste your time teaching Git? Because it is magic for programmer, and you should learn magic!

# Installation

https://git-scm.com/downloads

Just get there, and install the Git according to your machine.

All done? It should be simple, but holla me if you encounter any problem.

# Sign-Up

Yep, you need to sign up. I suggest Bitbucket if you starting up and want a private project.

If you want to contribute to the Git community, sign up for Github. Both are fun!

# Your computer identity

Hey, the world need to know what your name is. Let's set it up.

To test if your Git is correctly installed, just type this command inside your terminal/command prompt:

	$ git

If it is installed correctly, it will show you the whole available command to play around later. If you got any error, probably there's an error while installing it.

Now assuming you have it correctly installed, we will first setup our username:

	$ git config --global user.name "Xavier-IV"

Yep, that's my nickname. Either way, you can put it up anything you like!
Now, we will set up your email:

	$ git config --global user.email email@example.com

Ready for fun? Heads up for the next tutorial!
